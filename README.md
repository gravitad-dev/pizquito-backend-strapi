## üßæ Monthly Billing Cron

This project includes an automated monthly billing cron that generates:
- Student invoices based on active enrollment services
- Employee payroll invoices based on active contract terms

Location: `config/cron-tasks.ts` (task key: `monthly_billing`)

### Default schedule
- Runs at 00:00 (midnight) on the configured day of the month
- Timezone: `Europe/Madrid`
- Default day: `25` (configurable via environment)

Default rule: `0 0 0 ${CRON_BILLING_DAY || 25} * *`

### Configuration (environment variables)
- `CRON_BILLING_DAY` (optional): Day of month to run (defaults to `25`)
- `BILLING_CRON_RULE` (optional): Full cron rule to override the default
  - Examples:
    - `0 0 5 25 * *` ‚Üí run on the 25th at 05:00 (Europe/Madrid)
    - `0 0 0 1 * *` ‚Üí run on the 1st at 00:00 (Europe/Madrid)
    - `* * * * *` ‚Üí every minute (development testing only)

See examples in `.env.example`, `.env.example.development`, and `.env.example.production`.

### What gets created
- Enrollment invoices
  - Only for active enrollments
  - Aggregates amounts from active `student_service` services with `amount > 0`
  - Avoids duplicates by checking invoices within the current month window
- Employee payroll invoices
  - Only for active employees
  - Uses the latest contract term:
    - Monthly: `hourlyRate * workedHours` (or falls back to fixed `hourlyRate`)
    - Weekly/Biweekly/Daily: `hourlyRate * workedHours` (basic estimate)
  - Avoids duplicates by checking invoices within the current month window

### Logs
- On each run, Strapi logs entries like:
  - `[Cron] Ejecutando facturaci√≥n mensual (alumnos y n√≥minas)`
  - `[Cron] Facturas de alumnos creadas: <n>`
  - `[Cron] N√≥minas de empleados creadas: <n>`

### Testing tips
- Temporarily set `BILLING_CRON_RULE="* * * * *"` in development to verify creation
- Revert to the default monthly schedule once tested
